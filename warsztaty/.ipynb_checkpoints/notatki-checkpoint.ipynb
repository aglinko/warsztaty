    "Data science is about understanding systems, whether they be natural systems such as climate, or man-made systems like the economy. Scientists have been conducting experiments for centuries, but recent advances in technology have enabled us to utilize data to understand systems at a much larger scale. Individual data points represent snapshots of a system's behavior, and as you collect more data on that system, you build up a dataset that you can use to analyze and understand the system as a whole. Some examples of datasets include:\n",

    "Police shootings in the U.S.\n",
    "You can apply data science techniques to virtually any field. One high-profile example of applied data science is the Netflix prize, where algorithms were developed to predict which movies viewers would enjoy. Another is the Heritage health prize, in which teams developed algorithms to identify the type of person most likely to be hospitalized in the near future.\n",
    "To work with data effectively, you need to learn how to program. Familiar software products like Microsoft Excel allow you to explore data, but aren't suitable for data science because they:\n",
